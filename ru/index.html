            <h2>История</h2>
            <p>I trusted G2A with my money, and they completely screwed me over. I ordered a product, paid with Bitcoin,
                and sent the exact amount to their wallet. The blockchain confirms it went through, but G2A claims they
                never got it. My order’s stuck on "Waiting for payment," and their support is a total black hole—zero
                answers, just automated garbage. I’m out money, time, and patience, and I’m done staying quiet. This is
                my warning: don’t let G2A rip you off like they did me.</p>

            <h2>What Went Down</h2>
            <p>I placed an order on <strong>G2A.com</strong>, paid with Bitcoin, and sent the exact amount to their
                provided wallet address. The transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, but G2A’s system is too broken
                to recognize it. My order still says "Waiting for payment." This isn’t a glitch—it’s a scam.</p>

            <h2>G2A's Response</h2>
            <p>After multiple attempts to contact G2A support, I received nothing but automated replies. They claim they
                need more time to investigate, but it’s clear they’re just stalling. I’ve provided all the necessary
                information, including transaction IDs and screenshots, but they refuse to acknowledge my payment.</p>

            <h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
            <p>This isn’t just my problem; it’s a warning for anyone thinking about using G2A. They’re not just a shady
                marketplace; they’re a scam operation that will take your money and run. If you value your hard-earned
                cash, stay far away from G2A.</p>
            <p>G2A is notorious for selling stolen keys and providing zero accountability. They’ve been in hot water
                before, and this is just another example of their shady practices. Don’t be the next victim.</p>
