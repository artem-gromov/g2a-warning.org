    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>I trusted G2A with my money, and they completely screwed me over. I ordered a product, paid with Bitcoin, and sent the exact amount to their wallet. The blockchain confirms it went through, but G2A claims they never got it. My order’s stuck on "Waiting for payment," and their support is a total black hole—zero answers, just automated garbage. I’m out money, time, and patience, and I’m done staying quiet. This is my warning: don’t let G2A rip you off like they did me.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>What Went Down</h2>
    <p>I placed an order on <strong>G2A.com</strong>, paid with Bitcoin, and sent the exact amount to their provided wallet address. The transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, but G2A’s system is too broken to recognize it. My order still says "Waiting for payment." This isn’t a glitch—it’s a scam.</p>

    <h2>G2A's Response</h2>
    <p>After multiple attempts to contact G2A support, I received nothing but automated replies. They claim they need more time to investigate, but it’s clear they’re just stalling. I’ve provided all the necessary information, including transaction IDs and screenshots, but they refuse to acknowledge my payment.</p>
